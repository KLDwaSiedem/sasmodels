This model calculates the scattering from a stack of repeating lamellar structures. The stacks of lamellae (infinite
in lateral dimension) are treated as a paracrystal to account for the repeating spacing. The repeat distance is further
characterized by a Gaussian polydispersity. **This model can be used for large multilamellar vesicles.**

*2.1.33.1. Definition*

The scattering intensity *I(q)* is calculated as

.. image:: img/image145.jpg

The form factor of the bilayer is approximated as the cross section of an infinite, planar bilayer of thickness *t*

.. image:: img/image146.jpg

Here, the scale factor is used instead of the mass per area of the bilayer (*G*). The scale factor is the volume
fraction of the material in the bilayer, *not* the total excluded volume of the paracrystal. *Z*\ :sub:`N`\ *(q)*
describes the interference effects for aggregates consisting of more than one bilayer. The equations used are (3-5)
from the Bergstrom reference below.

Non-integer numbers of stacks are calculated as a linear combination of the lower and higher values

.. image:: img/image147.jpg

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as 1D, regardless of the orientation of the *q* vector which is defined as

.. math::

    Q = \sqrt{Q_x^2 + Q_y^2}

The parameters of the model are *Nlayers* = no. of layers, and *pd_spacing* = polydispersity of spacing.

Our model uses the form factor calculations implemented in a c-library provided by the NIST Center for Neutron Research
(Kline, 2006).
